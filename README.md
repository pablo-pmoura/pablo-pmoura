## Facts about me
- I believe that Consistent working always wins over intense working. Every day is different, so we can't always do all the things we have to, but we can do something every day. Don't underestimate the long term achievements.
- I'm passionate about Graphic Design and creating beautiful yet functional websites and systems
- I'm a metalhead so you'll always see me listening to bands like Pantera, Slipknot, Rage Against the Machine, etc.
